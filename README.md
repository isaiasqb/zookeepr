# zookeepr

In this project, you can find a web server using the Express.js framework added to a front-end application from a fictional local zoo.
The siteâ€™s data will live on a server that was specifically build for this peoject so that anyone can access it without having to download it. 
The app will also be deployed to Heroku, a cloud application platform that allows you to deploy applications with servers to a webpage.
